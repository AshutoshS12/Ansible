        Msg: Url in Task = {{URL}}

    - name: Access URL in task1
        ansible.builtin.debug:
          Msg: Url in Task = {{URL}}

## Declare Variable in play level then all the task  can access the variable

- name: File level Variable
  hosts: all
  vars_files:
    - sample.vars.yml
  tasks:
    - name: Access URL
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        Msg: Url = {{URL}}

## Declare Variable in File level then all the task  can access the variable

- name: Task level Variable
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Access URL from Task Var
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        Msg: Url = {{URL}}
      vars:
        URL: task.sample.com

## Declare Variable in Task level then all the task  can access the variable,scope is only the same task.

## vi ../inv
## Insert : URL=inventory.example.com

- name: Inventory level Variable
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Access URL from inventory File
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        Msg: Url = {{URL}}


- name: CLI level Variable
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Access CLI Variable
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        Msg: Url = {{URL}}

## To access CLI variable we need to use the -e option with Variable value, example as below
## ansible-playbook -i ../inv -u centos -k 02-vars.yml -e URL=cli.google.com,but when declared it will replace the value all across

- name: Print Facts
  hosts: all
  vars:
    ansible_distribution: sample
  tasks:
    - name: Print a Fact
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "HOST OS = {{ansible_distribution}}"
## Generally, It's a good practice we don't start our user variable with ansible_ , because those are system facts fromm ansible

- name: Runtime Variable
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Get uptime command output
      ansible.builtin.shell: uptime
      register: OUT
      ## OUT is a variable
    - name: Print Out
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "{{OUT.stdout}}"
    - name: Set Fact
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        UPTIME_OUTPUT: "{{OUT.stdout}}"

## Variable values need not to be quoted while declaring
## Variable while accessing also need not to be quoted, Unless if the value is starting with variable.
## Meaning
## Hello {{URL}} need not to be quoted becuase this is not starting with variable
## {{URL} Hello , then yes it need to be quoted since it is starting with a variable
## Booleans while quoted considers as string,
## Number quoted are not consider as string, those are still consider as numbers.
